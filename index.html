<legend>Defenation of programming languages</legend>

 <p>It is the process in which the programmer writes a code which is represented by a set of commands,
 which in turn are executed on the computers. A programming language is a special language that is used by programmers to write programs, scripts, or another set of commands to execute on a computer.

    <ol>According to the level 
    
    <li class=" newcolor ">
     low-level programming languages
     <q class ="newcolor1">which are the programming languages closest to the machine language, so the machine language is the lowest level,
     and comes at a lower level after which the assembly language,
     as these languages are characterized by the fact that it only includes the commands that the computer understands
     It is therefore the most distant from the language a person understands, but at the same time it allows the programmer to have full control of his program.
     </q>
    </li>
    <li class=" newcolor ">high-level programming languages
    <q class ="newcolor1">which are the furthest from the machine language, and the closest to understanding the human being, but they
    also do not provide the same amount of control as the low-level languages the programmer provides,
    in terms of how the computer organizes memory and data. One of the important features
    of high-level programming languages is that the programmer can use variables and objects in addition to routines and repetitions
     Sometimes, through high-level programming languages, a large number of commands can be executed by writing only one line
    </q>
    </li>
    </ol> 
  
    
        <ol>According to the way it is implemented
         <li class=" newcolor ">
                    translated or converted programming languages
             <q class ="newcolor1">
              where the translated programming languages are used, and the translator program is used to convert it into a machine language
              dedicated to the operating system that The translation process has been done on it, and it is in the form of a program that
              can be executed by calling its name. If the operation took place in the Linux operating system for example,
              The user will not be able to execute the same program on the Windows operating system, just as in the conversion process,
              the program is examined and detected for any errors - not logical - in it.
              An example of this type of programming language is C in the interpreted programming languages
             </q>
         </li>
                <li class=" newcolor ">
                   the interpreted programming languages
                <q class ="newcolor1">
                 is used to implement the program directly without the need to translate it, as the texts (or so-called script) are executed by
                 the interpreter program itself, so the interpreted program must be installed on any device that is intended to run
                 the program written on it, which makes this type of program executable on Any operating system as long as the interpreted
                 program is installed on it. One of the features of the interpreted programming languages is the ability of the programmer
                 to directly modify the program without the need to re-translate it (as in translated programming languages),
                 but the interpreter's ongoing process during the program's operation will make the implementation process
                 slow compared to the converted programs. An example of this type of programming language is Python
